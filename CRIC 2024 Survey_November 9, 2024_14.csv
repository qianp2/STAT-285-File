The standards laid out by SJP and CSA are especially unclear and should not be acted upon. SJP continually advocates for divesting from any company that has any tie to any company that has any tie to Israel (e.g. GE Vernova), a third order standard that would require liquidating large portions of the portfolio.

Although a disvestement proposal is references as attached (I am not referring to the resolution itself), I could not find it. The effect of any Carleton action will depend on how sensible it it is. I am strongly in favor of action to stop what Netanyahu is doing (and our family includes Holocaust survvors). But arming Isreal is a US government project and not every organization that provides parts is a reasonable target. Likewise, we are stuck with fossil fuel in the short term, so action action such a company makes little sense, Joining in the reasonable actions of others seems most likely to be effective.",Unknown,,

An attempt to influence via investment seems futile and naive.  Additionally, I would like to understand the overall purpose and mission of the endowment and how it has shaped over the years.  Focusing on whether or not the endowment is constantly going up seems in opposition to the purpose of the endowment which I believe is to solidify the financial stability of the college during difficult times and to fund certain initiatives.  I am highly disappointed that Carleton charge the amount that they due for tuition without an attempt to offset especially for families that fall outside of the super wealthy or the extreme poor.  Both of my children were accepted to go to Carleton and did not and I am thankful as the cost of the college would have been an extreme financial burden on our family and, in my humble opinion, not worth the investment.  Use the endowment to defray costs and keep the culture of Carleton with exceptional students of all walks of life.  The student population currently is extremely polarized.  How can the school justify having over a $1B endowment and not address the most important part of the college - the student population and the mix of it based on financial status?",Unknown,,
