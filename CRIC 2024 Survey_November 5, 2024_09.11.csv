Carleton, in my opinion, is not a large enough player in the support of weapons manufacturers to divest that much from the endowment, especially because the endowment allows more opportunities for low income students to attend college etc. etc. that people overlook when they call for Carleton to divest from something that they seem to not understand.

When Carleton, along with many other colleges and universities, divested from companies that did business in South Africa in the 1970s-1980s, we directly contributed to the end of apartheid. Carleton has done this before, and we can--and should--do it again. In 50 years, do we want the Carleton community to be proud of our history, or ashamed of our actions? We have an ethical obligation to our fellow human beings. We must divest now."

An attempt to influence via investment seems futile and naive.  Additionally, I would like to understand the overall purpose and mission of the endowment and how it has shaped over the years.  Focusing on whether or not the endowment is constantly going up seems in opposition to the purpose of the endowment which I believe is to solidify the financial stability of the college during difficult times and to fund certain initiatives.  I am highly disappointed that Carleton charge the amount that they due for tuition without an attempt to offset especially for families that fall outside of the super wealthy or the extreme poor.  Both of my children were accepted to go to Carleton and did not and I am thankful as the cost of the college would have been an extreme financial burden on our family and, in my humble opinion, not worth the investment.  Use the endowment to defray costs and keep the culture of Carleton with exceptional students of all walks of life.  The student population currently is extremely polarized.  How can the school justify having over a $1B endowment and not address the most important part of the college - the student population and the mix of it based on financial status?"

For me to feel confident about my stance on divestment for our college, it would be helpful to know the impact that this percentage of divestment has on our campus community. How would the campus community be impacted by divesting 1% - 3%? What plan would be put in place to make up the difference for divesting?"
